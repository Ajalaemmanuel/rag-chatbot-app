# Document-Based Q&A with RAG

This is a full-stack web application that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It allows users to upload a text document and ask questions about its content. The backend is built with Python and Flask, and it uses a language model to provide intelligent answers.

## Features

* **Document Upload**: Upload `.txt` files or paste raw text.
* **Intelligent Q&A**: Ask questions and receive answers generated by a language model based on the document's content.
* **Simple Web Interface**: Easy-to-use chat interface for interaction.

    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    * **Windows:**
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS / Linux:**
        ```sh

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    Open a terminal and run the following command. The first time you run this, it may take a few minutes to download the language model.
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Open the frontend:**
    Navigate to the project folder and open the `Home.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it).

3.  **Use the application:**
    * First, submit a document by pasting text or uploading a `.txt` file.
    * Once the document is processed, you can ask questions about it in the chat window.
